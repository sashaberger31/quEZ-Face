# quEZ-Face 
The most painful yet *function*al q-analog (prounounced /kwˈænəˌlɔg/) multiple zeta calculator on the internet, quEZ-face (prounounced /kwˈiːzifeɪs/) is designed to assist in any and all computation involving MZVs, AMZVs, CMZVs, or their q-analogs, the qMZVs (pronounced /kwˈəmziviːz/). 

The most *fun*ctional!

# About
We are heavily inspired by the widely beloved online zeta calculator "EZ-Face" of the Center for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics. However, this calculator is focused on a q-analog of the MZV's, as testing conjectures relating to these requires an immense amount of algebra and computation.

Special thanks to Dr. Jianqiang Zhao, who introduced us to zetology (not an actual name) and led us through some of it's murkiest trenches. For the interested reader stumbling across this website or one who seeks to support it, we strongly recommend his fascination book linked here. 

# Who inspired you to make this site?
Besides our obvious inspiration from Dr. Zhao, the dedication of some other researchers has emboldened us. Among others, we would like to thank Don Zagier, Masanobu Kaneko, Maxim Kontsevich, Yasuo Ohno, Minuru Hirose and Hideki Murahara. If any zetologists are actually using this site, we'd love to hear from you!
